Complete your reading of Chapter 2, section 2.3 - 2.5 (If you don't have a copy of the textbook yet, there is one on reserve at the library under "COMP000-STAFF - Permanent Reserve").

<ol markdown="1">
1. (2 pts) Why does the textbook recommend using namespaces in your programs? 
<div style="margin-bottom:4em"></div>

2. (6 pts) Consider the point class defined and implemented on page 64 and 65 of the book and answer the following questions 
<div style="margin-bottom:2em"></div>
a. Describe the value semantics of the point class. 
<div style="margin-bottom:4em"></div>
b. What is the output of the following code (embedded in a correct main program)? 
```
point p1, p2(20.0), p3(50,60); 
cout<<p1.get_x()<<" "<<p1.get_y()<<endl;
cout<<p2.get_x()<<" "<<p2.get_y()<<endl;
cout<<p3.get_x()<<" "<<p3.get_y()<<endl;
p1 = p3;
p1.rotate90();
cout<<p1.get_x()<<" "<<p1.get_y()<<endl;
```
c. Is the default copy constructor invoked in the above code?

<div style="margin-bottom:4em"></div>

3. (2 pts) On page 72, why does the distance() function parameters of type const reference?  
<div style="margin-bottom:2em"></div>
<div class="pagebreak"></div>

4. (8 pts) For the point class on page 64 and 65, implement the overloaded parameter '*', so that it is possible to scale the x and y values of a point by a fixed number. Usage: point p3 = 2*p1; In this example p3's x and y coorinates should be double that of p1. Specify whether you would implement the operator as a member function, a non-member function or a friend function, and why?
<div style="margin-bottom:20em"></div>

5. (8 pts) For the point class on page 64 and 65, implement the overloaded parameter '+=', so that for two points p1 and p2, p1+=p2, produces the effect of adding p2's x and y member variables to the corresponding member variables of p1. Usage: p1+=p2;  Specify whether you would implement the operator as a member function, a non-member function or a friend function, and why?
<div style="margin-bottom:20em"></div>
