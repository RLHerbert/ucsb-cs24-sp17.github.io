# Resources <a name="resources"></a>

## Required Resources

* Required textbook: Michael Main and Walter Savitch. Data Structures and Other Objects Using C++ (4th edition), Addison-Wesley, 2011.

* Recommended textbook: Problem Solving with C++, Walter Savitch, Edition 9. Available for purchase at the UCSB book store

* Peer Instruction : iClickers: The course lectures will follow a Peer Instruction format, a teaching model which places stronger emphasis on classroom discussion and student interaction. As part of this you will need to own an iClicker register it on the [Gauchospace](https://gauchospace.ucsb.edu/courses/course/view.php?id=1524)). Be sure to register your clicker by the end of the first week.


## What you should know to be ready for CS24 

<p>Here's the  list of a few important things you'll need to know to be ready for CS24.</p>

* A few of the basic data types of C++, including at least, int, double, char, bool, string
* The basic control structures of C++ (if/else, while, for etc.)
* Defining functions in C++, and passing parameters to functions in three different ways (by value, by pointer, and by reference)
* Scope and lifetime of variables in C++
* The use of "const" with parameters to functions
* Using arrays in C++, and C-strings (null-terminated character arrays)
* How arrays are passed to functions, and the relationship between arrays and pointers
* Defining and working with structs in C++
* Using structs to create singly linked lists where the space for the list nodes is allocated on the heap
* The difference between space allocated on the stack (e.g. local variables) and space allocated on the heap (with the new and delete operators)
* Converting from binary to decimal, octal, and hex, and back again&mdash;and how this relates to how C++ programs store various kinds of data in memory.
* The basic principles of recursion, and some idea of when a recursive solution is appropriate.


## Course policies <a name="policies"></a>

## Grade breakup by evaluation component
* Lecture and section partcipation: 2%
* Homeworks/Quizzes: 8%
* Lab assignments: 40% 
* Midterm Exams (2 at 15% each): 30%
* Final Examination : 20%

Less than 75% iClicker response â‰¡ missing a lecture

# Course objectives

* Students learn object-based programming techniques: abstraction and encapsulation.
* Students learn to specify, implement and apply lists, trees and other data structures.
* Students are exposed to complexity analysis, and learn to distinguish algorithms and data structures on the basis of efficiency.
* Students learn (and practice) to produce better programs more quickly and with less stress.
