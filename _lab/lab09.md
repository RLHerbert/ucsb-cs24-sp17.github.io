Step by Step Instructions

Step 1: TA evaluations

Please complete the TA evaluations when the forms are given to you.

This lab step is important to us, and you can only earn credit today by attending your lab session on Tuesday, November 29 - and only if you arrive in time to complete it. The forms will be distributed no later than 5 minutes past the hour that begins your lab session. Don't be late!
Step 2: If necessary, work on Programming Assignment 6

If you have not already finished PA6, then work on it now:

PA6 is due tonight.
Step 3: Seek help, and help others with course topics as needed

The third exam is tomorrow (Wednesday) at 12:30 in the usual lecture room, Psych 1924. It will be a 60-minute exam, focusing mostly on the primary topics covered in lectures since the last exam - recursion and binary trees - and the general searching concepts presented in Monday's lecture.

Review your notes from recent lectures, and recall any questions you still have unanswered about the following chapters and sections from the text that possibly will be on the exam:

All of Chapters 9 (Recursive Thinking) and 10 (Trees).
All except Section 11.3 (B-Trees) from Chapter 11 (Balanced Trees).
Section 12.1, introductory parts of Sections 12.2-12.4 from Chapter 12 (Searching).
Take advantage of the TA's presence - as well as the presence of your classmates - to ask questions about any of these possible third exam topics. This also is an opportunity to get help for PA6 if you need it.

Evaluation and Grading

Each student must accomplish the following to earn full credit for this lab:

[50 points] The student arrived on time to their lab session - in time to fill out a TA evaluation form at the start of the session - and participated in Steps 2 and 3 until finished or the lab ended.
If you are finished with all of your assigned work (including TA evaluations), then you may leave early today - but only after you make sure the TA has recorded your attendance and participation. When you are done seeking help and done giving help to other students, then ask the TA to excuse you, and wait for the TA's consent to leave.
