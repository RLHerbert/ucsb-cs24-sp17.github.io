# Topics

## Getting our feet wet 
* What will you learn in CS 16?
* Getting to know your peers, the instructor and staff!
* We are running a new pilot program where undergraduate tutors will be assisting with instructional activities - we will introduce our tutors, be sure to reach out to them in labs and sections 

## Hardware abstractions
* The modern digital computer - stored program model and the Von Neumann architecture, why are we talking about architecture?
* The hardware/software interface
## Getting set up 
* Remote login to the CSIL servers
* Finding your way around with basic unix commands - mkdir, ls, cp, mv, rm (use
  with caution)
* Choosing an editor (vim or emacs)- may the best editor win!

## C++ basics - main, std i/o, if-else, variables
* Basic elements of a C++ program introduced via the "hello world" program and the game of fizzbuzz!
    * the main function
    * namepsaces and include directives
    * commenting your code
    * standard input, standard output and standard error with cin, cout, cerr
* Unlike Python, you MUST "declare" variables on first appearance in any C++ program. We'll discuss what this means.
* If else statements are DIFFERENT in C++ than in Python. We'll discuss.
* Compiling with g++
* Running your program
