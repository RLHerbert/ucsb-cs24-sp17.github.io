# Code from lecture

# Topics 
* Intro to lab01
* For, while and do-while loops - Discussion on when to use each
* Nested loops 
* Generating random numbers with rand()
* Practice with a game of die
If time permits - introduce functions
* Basic abstraction in software: functions
* C++ functions are different from Python functions


* Gentle intro to github: what is a repo, creating a repo,  cloning a repo to a local machine, syncing repos with git add, commit and push

Software developers almost always prefer to use github's command line tools for version control instead of the web interface. The reason is that with the command-line tools you can (1) use your favorite editor to write your code, instead of github's simple web-based editor (2) compile and test your code, while also performing version control. 

* Read the articles on [creating a github repo under an organization](https://ucsb-cs16.github.io/topics/github_com_create_private_repo_under_org/), [cloning your first repo](https://ucsb-cs56-pconrad.github.io/topics/git_cloning_your_first_repo/) and [git basic workflow](https://ucsb-cs56-pconrad.github.io/topics/git_basic_workflow/).  We will now put the concepts from all the articles that you have read so far into practice. You may need to refer back to these articles to complete the following steps.
